This subprojects contains solutions for task about developing iterator walking through binary tree in depth.
The following constrasints shoulds be considered:
  * O(1) RAM consumption
  * Minimal as possible ciclomatic complexity

Both provided solutinos are based on scala however the first one is just java-like straitforward algorithm. While the second one uses monades and other funnctionla stuff.
